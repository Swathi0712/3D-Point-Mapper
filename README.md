# 3D Point Mapper

A real-time 3D spatial mapping system using Arduino, ESP8266, ultrasonic sensors, and gyroscope for creating 3D models of objects and environments.

## Overview

The 3D Point Mapper is a low-cost, open-source, real-time 3D spatial mapping system. It uses a combination of ultrasonic sensors and a gyroscope to create a 3D point cloud of an object or environment. The device is battery-powered and transmits the data wirelessly to a web server for real-time visualization and export.
